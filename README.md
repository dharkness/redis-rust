This is a starting point for Rust solutions to the
["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis).

In this challenge, you'll build a toy Redis clone that's capable of handling
basic commands like `PING`, `SET` and `GET`. Along the way we'll learn about
event loops, the Redis protocol and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.

# Running

1. Ensure you have `cargo (1.54)` installed locally
1. Run `./spawn_redis_server.sh` to run your Redis server, which is implemented
   in `src/main.rs`. This command compiles your Rust project, so it might be
   slow the first time you run it. Subsequent runs will be fast.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.

# Next Steps

- Parse raw buffer
    - Read directly into incoming as a buffer (keep index)
    - Parse from buffer without converting to a string (done)
    - Input uses byte slices
    - Parser uses tree of letters to find command
    - Store uses byte slices
- Move command running to server
